# Fantasy Name Generator

This simple plugin for Obsidian lets you create random fantasy names from a simple action within Obsidian.

## How to use

In the command palette, select the action "Fantasy Name Generator: Generate a name".  The selected text will be replaced with a name, and the inserted name will be selected.

Do you want a given name with bias toward a particular gender?  Highlight "m" or "f" in your text and activate the action to draw given names from the respective list.  If you repeat the action while a name is selected, the plugin will continue to supply names from the list that contains the hightlighted name.  This will allow you to repeatedly activate the action until you get a name that you like without the plugin switching genders on you.

It's fastest to assign a hotkey to this action.

## How I use this plugin

My whole D&D campaign knowledge base is stored in Obsidian.  When my players ask about a character that I haven't already produced a name for, I can quickly press my hotkey and have a name ready in my log as if I had planned it out all along.
